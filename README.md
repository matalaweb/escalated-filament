A [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) admin panel plugin for the [Escalated](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated-laravel) support ticket system. Manage tickets, departments, SLA policies, escalation rules, macros, and more — all from within your existing Filament admin panel.

## How It Works

Escalated for Filament is a **Filament plugin wrapper** around [`escalated-laravel`](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated-laravel). It does not duplicate any business logic. Instead, it provides Filament Resources, Pages, Widgets, and Actions that call the same services, models, and events from the core Laravel package. This means:

- All ticket lifecycle logic, SLA calculations, and escalation rules come from `escalated-laravel`
- Database tables, migrations, and configuration are managed by the core package
- Events, notifications, and webhooks fire exactly as they would from the Inertia UI
- You get a native Filament experience without maintaining a separate codebase

> **Note:** This package uses Filament's native Livewire + Blade components (tables, forms, info lists, actions, widgets) rather than the custom Vue 3 + Inertia.js UI from the [`@escalated-dev/escalated`](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated) frontend package. The core functionality is the same — same models, services, database, and business logic — but the UI look-and-feel follows Filament's design system. Some interactions may differ slightly (e.g., Filament modals vs. inline forms, Filament table filters vs. custom filter components). If you need pixel-perfect parity with the Inertia frontend, use `escalated-laravel` directly with the shared Vue components instead.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 11 or 12
- Filament 3.x, 4.x, or 5.x
- escalated-dev/escalated-laravel ^0.5

### Version Compatibility

| escalated-filament | Filament | Laravel | PHP  |
|--------------------|----------|---------|------|
| 0.5.x              | 3.x, 4.x, 5.x | 11, 12  | 8.2+ |

## Installation

### 1. Install the packages

```bash
composer require escalated-dev/escalated-laravel escalated-dev/escalated-filament
```

If you already have `escalated-laravel` installed, just add the Filament plugin:

```bash
composer require escalated-dev/escalated-filament
```

### 2. Run the Escalated installer (if not already done)

```bash
php artisan escalated:install
php artisan migrate
```

### 3. Define authorization gates

In a service provider (e.g., `AppServiceProvider`):

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

Gate::define('escalated-admin', fn ($user) => $user->is_admin);
Gate::define('escalated-agent', fn ($user) => $user->is_agent || $user->is_admin);
```

### 4. Register the plugin in your Filament panel

```php
use Escalated\Filament\EscalatedFilamentPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(
            EscalatedFilamentPlugin::make()
                ->navigationGroup('Support')
                ->agentGate('escalated-agent')
                ->adminGate('escalated-admin')
        );
}
```

You're live. Visit your Filament panel — a **Support** navigation group will appear with all ticket management resources.

## Configuration

The plugin is configured through method chaining on the plugin instance:

```php
EscalatedFilamentPlugin::make()
    ->navigationGroup('Support')    // Navigation group label (default: 'Support')
    ->agentGate('escalated-agent')  // Gate for agent access (default: 'escalated-agent')
    ->adminGate('escalated-admin')  // Gate for admin access (default: 'escalated-admin')
```

All other configuration (SLA, hosting modes, notifications, etc.) is managed by the core `escalated-laravel` package in `config/escalated.php`. See the [escalated-laravel README](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated-laravel) for full configuration reference.
